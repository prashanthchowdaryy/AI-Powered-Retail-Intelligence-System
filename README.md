AI-Powered Retail Intelligence System

(AI for Bharat Hackathon – Powered by AWS)

 Project Overview

Retail has always been about instinct — knowing what sells, when it sells, and why it sells.
This project brings that instinct into the age of AI.

The AI-Powered Retail Intelligence System helps retailers predict product demand, analyze sales trends, and make smarter inventory decisions using machine learning. Instead of static reports, it delivers predictive insights that look ahead, not just backward.

Built as part of the AI for Bharat Hackathon, this solution focuses on real-world retail challenges faced by small and medium businesses in India.

👥 Team Details

Team Name: Friday

Team Leader: Prashanth Chowdary

Problem Statement: AI for Retail, Commerce & Market Intelligence

 Problem Statement

Retailers deal with massive volumes of historical and unstructured data:

Sales records

Inventory data

Customer buying patterns

Traditional tools only show what already happened, forcing manual interpretation and guesswork.
This leads to:

Overstocking or stock-outs

Missed sales opportunities

Inefficient planning

💡 Proposed Solution

An AI-driven retail intelligence system that:

Learns from historical sales and customer data

Predicts future product demand

Identifies high- and low-performing products

Provides actionable insights via a simple dashboard

The system replaces rule-based logic with machine learning models, enabling smarter, scalable, and proactive decision-making.

🚀 Key Features

AI-Based Demand Forecasting
Predicts future product demand using ML models.
